The integrity of the pvm.exe file can be verified using the SHA512 checksum.

Provided SHA512 checksum:
101ac193d9d40ecfc28964dc6c0090769aab407c523fef1105adb83cb9c78b95e2c70771c42122db87cf20d467fa40ea90a78b6e88b5f896a67d07356e6165f7

To verify the checksum, you can use the following command in PowerShell:
certUtil -hashfile C:\path\to\your\pvm.exe SHA512

Or using the checksum tool:
checksum -t sha512 -f C:\path\to\your\pvm.exe

Ensure that the calculated checksum matches the provided checksum to confirm the integrity of the file.

Additionally, you can verify the file by downloading it directly from the official project repository:
